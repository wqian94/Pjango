Middleware
==========

Middleware are a concept designed to change the environment
that you are working in. In Pjango, they are mostly used to
post-process the templates after rendering.

Unlike tags and filters, which tend to affect only sections of
the rendered text, middleware affects pretty much the entire
rendered text. As such, when writing and using middleware, be
aware of its effects on your entire code.

Details about the AbstractMiddleware class, custom middleware and
built-in middleware are available.
