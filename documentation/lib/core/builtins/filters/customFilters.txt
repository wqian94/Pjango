Custom Filters
==============

Although the built-in filters are sufficient for most puposes,
you may find the need to develop your own filters. In fact, you
are encouraged to implement additional filters to better suit
your website.

Creating a custom filter is very simple. Once the core
sublibrary has been included in your PHP script (done at the
top of "settings.php"), you can create a custom filter by
extending the AbstractFilter class (documentation provided here)
and defining the render() function.

The render() function takes in three arguments: $args, $var,
and &$vars.

$args is an array of the arguments passed into your filter.

$var is the value for your filter to manipulate; this could be
anything from a simple string or number to an array or an
instance of a class.

$vars is the associative array of the current system variables
at runtime. This is especially important for for-loops, as they
update the current system variables with each iteration. Since
it is passed by reference, be wary of mutating this variable.

Additionally, your render() function can also return any value,
including arrays and objects, though be advised that if no
other filters are used to further process them, they will be
converted to strings and printed as strings.

Finally, you will need to register your filter with the __SITE
class by using the __SITE::addFilter($name,$instance) function,
where $name is the character string that will be the associated
name of your filter, and $instance is an instance of the filter
class that you just created.

For example, the code for the length filter is reproduced below

"
1 class __Filter_length extends AbstractFilter{
2   public static function render($args,$var,&$vars){
3     if(is_array($var))
4       return count($var);
5     return strlen($var);
6   }
7 }
8 __SITE::addFilter("length",new __Filter_length);
"

Now, the custom filter can be used in a template.
