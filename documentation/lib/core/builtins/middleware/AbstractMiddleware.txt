abstract class AbstractMiddleware
=================================

Found in "lib/core/core.php", the AbstractMiddleware class
serves as a basic template for all middleware. Moreover, in
for a middleware class to be successfully registered and used,
it must extend from this class.

Note that the "preprocess" and "render" functions are public
and static; as such, instance variables and functions cannot be
used within a filter class. Static and class variables are
still viable.
 
Functions
 
public static preprocess()
  -- Applies the preprocessing rules of this middleware to the
     site before any rendering is done. Mostly, this allows the
     middleware to check for any conditions to throw errors at.

     By default, nothing is done.

public static render($text)
  -- Applies this middleware to the rendered string. Must
     return a resulting string, or else nothing will be printed
     in the end.

     By default, the input text is returned.
