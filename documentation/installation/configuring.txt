Variables Set-Up and Configuration
==================================

As with unpacking and installing, the easiest way to configure
your variables is to use the built-in index.php page.

However, if you wish to configure Pjango on your own, manualy,
navigate to the lib directory and open the settings.php file.
Here, you will find all the configuration variables that you
will need to update. Upon updating, your configuration will be
complete.
