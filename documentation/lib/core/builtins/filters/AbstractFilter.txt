abstract class AbstractFilter
=============================

Found in "lib/core/core.php", the AbstractFilter class serves
as a basic template for all filters. Moreover, in order for a
filter to be executed, it must extend this class.

Note that the "render" function is public and static; as such,
instance variables and functions cannot be used within a filter
class. Static and class variables are still viable.

Also note that the "call_render" is final. This means that it
cannot be changed by child classes.
 
Functions
 
final public static call_render($container)
  -- Unwraps the container passed in and provides the arguments
	   to the "render()" function. Cannot, and should not be
		 overridden by child classes.

abstract public static render($args,$var,&$vars)
  -- Applies the filter to the content of $var, which may be a
     string, a number, an array, etc. $args contains the array
     of arguments passed into the filter, and $vars contains
     the system variables at runtime, passed by reference.

     This function must be overridden by any subclass, which
     includes all viable filters. The output should be another
     value, be it a string, number, array, etc. that represents
     the application of this filter on $var.
