class SQL
=========

The SQL class represents a condensed API for basic SQL queries
and data fetches. By internally using mysql_* or mysqli_*
based on the PHP version number, it allows for one set of API
to be used without worrying over deprecation and backsupport.

Moreover, the SQL class stores each and every connection that
is made, and allows for easy toggling between databases using
identification numbers.

Additionally, the SQL class provides the option of escaping the
input by using a boolean indicator, allowing for long-term
toggling between escaping and not escaping the input.
 
Static Variables
 
private escape -- Initialized as true, is the boolean
  indicator for whether to escape the input during querying.

private handles -- Initialized as an empty array, used to store
  the handles of the SQL connections made.

private latest -- Initialized as null, records the index of
  the currently-active connection handle.

private result -- Initialized as null, stores the result of
  the latest query, regardless of handle.

private use_sqlite -- Initialized as false, is the flag for
  determining whether to use SQLite3.
 
Functions
 
public static connect($host,$user,$passwd,$db)
  -- Establishes a connecion to $host, using username $user,
     with password $passwd, and selecting database $db and
     stores this connection in the handles array for use.
     Automatically sets latest to be the index of the new
     connection, and returns the connection established. Will
     use the self::open($db) function instead if the use_sqlite
     flag is true.

public static escape($escape=true)
  -- Sets the escape boolean indicator.

public static fetch($sqlresult=null)
  -- Uses *_fetch_array() to fetch the next result from the
     result resource. If the parameter is null, uses the static
     variable result instead. If use_sqlite is set to true,
     will use the SQLite3 library to fetch instead. The fetched
     array is returned.

public static handle()
  -- Returns the currently selected handle; that is,
     handles[latest].

public static index()
  -- Returns the value of latest.

public static open($db)
  -- Like self::connect(), but opens a local SQLite3 database
     instead. If the use_sqlite is not set to true, will throw
     an error. Also sets latest and returns connection handle.

public static query($query,$args=array(),$escape=null)
  -- Uses $query as a formatted string to include the arguments
     provided in $args, which are escaped based on the $escape
     parameter. If $escape is null, uses the static variable
     escape instead. The result is stored in result and is
     returned.

public static result()
  -- Returns the latest result from a query.

public static select($id)
  -- Selects the database connection with identifier $id. A
     negative identifier indicates offset from the last handle,
     going backwards. Will throw an error if the identifier is
     out of bounds.
