Pjango -- Django for PHP project
================================

Pjango is open-source project that aims to allow web developers
familiar with Django in Python to use the same templates in a
PHP environment. Furthermore, the basic goal is to provide
compatibility for Django templates being imported into PHP
projects; compability in the other direction need not be
guaranteed.
