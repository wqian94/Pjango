Writing Documentation
=====================

Pjango's documentation is rendered using a basic engine written
in PHP. This is the documentationCompiler.php script. Along
with the script, the documentation also has its own markup
language, designed specifically for writing Pjango
documentation, called PDML (Pjango Documentation Markup
Language).


PDML Files

All PDML files have the .pdml extension, and are preceded with
a "." (period). The engine then generates a .txt and a .htm
for each PDML file found, based on the filename.

Example:
A file named .index.pdml will generate index.txt and index.htm.

The PDML engine script will generate navigation menus in both
the TXT and HTM files; the HTM files have a linked navigation
system on the side, and the TXT files have a navigation map at
the bottom of the file. This is automatically generated when
the documentation is rendered. 

The structure of a PDML file is simple. Blocks begin with

"
<<<BLOCKNAME
"

and end with

"
BLOCKNAME>>>
"

There are two kinds of PDML files: standard documentation files
(like this one) and class documentation files.

Each standard file must have TITLE and CONTENT blocks, with an
optional SHORT block. The TITLE block provides the title of the
documentation page, as well as the title of the hyperlinks in
the navigation, and the SHORT block is text that links to the
page in the navigation. (In the TXT files, this is done as
[SHORT] TITLE). If a SHORT block is not provided, it will
default to the provided TITLE.

The CONTENT block contains the documentation itself, and is
what is displayed under the printed TITLE block on the page.
More information about the CONTENT block is below.

Similarly, a class documentation file has a CONTENT and an
optional SHORT block, but uses a CLASS block instead of a TITLE
block. A class documentation file can also have EXTENDS and
IMPLMENTS blocks to indicate extended and implemented classes.
Finally, a class documentation file can have STATIC_VARIABLES,
VARIABLES, and FUNCTIONS blocks, with obvious contents. The
display order for a class file's blocks is with CONTENT at the
top, followed by STATIC VARIABLES, then VARIABLES, and finally,
FUNCTIONS.


CONTENT Blocks

CONTENT blocks form the core of the documentation -- within the
CONTENT block is all the written documentation. By convention,
<h2> blocks are used to indicate section headings, <h3>
subheadings, and so on. <hr /> tags are also used as
section dividers.

Since the rendered documentation can be viewed in a browser,
any and all HTML tags are valid to use. Thus, it will become
necessary for you to use & to indicate tags specifically in
your documentation, such as for examples or using &lt;h2&gt;
to tell others to use HTML entities. Most HTML tags will be
stripped from the TXT version of the documentation.

There are, however, special tags that are defined specifically
for use in the documentation.

<var> without any attributes is a tag block that makes
the internal text monospaced.

<code> will also monospace the contents of the tag, but
will also render double quotes (") around the text in the TXT
version of the documentation.

<example> creates the green example boxes
like the one below, which does not render in the TXT
documentation:

Example:
<spaces> will convert all spaces within the block into
&nbsp; entities.

<iftxt> will only render its contents in the TXT version
of the documentation.

Furthermore, the code tags can be given the classes block and
bordered to change the display style or add a border to the tag
block.

Finally, for some mechanics. Each line rendered in the TXT
documentation should not exceed 63 characters, unless it is
necessary and important to the documentation to do so. Also,
every pair of empty lines (\n\n) will be converted
to (<br /><br />), and all additional
whitespace will be condensed to a single space. Finally, the
&amp;, &lt;, &amp;, and &vellip;
entities will be converted to their appropriate characters in
the TXT version (except that the vertical ellipses will be
horizontal).


Class Blocks

The three class blocks, STATIC_VARIABLES, VARIABLES, and
FUNCTIONS, have special utilies in the class documentation.

First, any <var> tags will be boldfaced in these
three tags, as long as it's in a class documentation file.

Second, as part of convention, variables and functions should
be listed in roughly alphabetical order, which must be done
manually.

Third, static and instance variables should not be referred to
with the preceding dollar sign ($); only function parameters
and variables used in the function, excluding class static and
instance variables, should have the preceding dollar sign. This
is mostly to prevent confusion between the class's variables
and the local variables.

Finally, variable and function identifiers should be separated
from their descriptions with a double-dash (--), and any part
of the description that goes on lines past the first should be
hanging-indented. See the PDML source for classes like __SITE
for further reference.
