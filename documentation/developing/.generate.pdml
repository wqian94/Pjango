There are two ways to generate the documentation. The first is
run the <var>make</var> command from the command line, at the
documentation. The second is to run the <var>documentationCompiler.php</var>
script from the documentation root.

If you wish to remove all TXT and HTM files, you can call
<var>make clean</var> or run the <var>documentationCleaner.php</var>
script.
