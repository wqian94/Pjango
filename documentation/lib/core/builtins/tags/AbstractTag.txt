abstract class AbstractTag
==========================

Found in "lib/core/core.php", the AbstractTag class serves as
a basic template for all tags. Moreover, in order for a tag to
be recognized, it must extend this class.

Note that the "render" function is public and static; as such,
instance variables and functions cannot be used within a filter
class. Static and class variables are still viable.

Also note that the "call_render" is final. This means that it
cannot be changed by child classes.
 
Functions
 
final public static call_render($container)
  -- Unwraps the container passed in and provides the arguments
	   to the "render()" function. Cannot, and should not be
		 overridden by child classes.

abstract public static render($args,$c,&$vars)
  -- Presents the tag with the component object $c, which is
     an instance of TagComponent, and the arguments passed into
     the tag, $args, with the current state of system variables
     at runtime, $vars, which is passed by reference.

     This function must be overridden by any subclass, which
     includes all viable tags. The output should be a string
     that represents the tag.

     Furthermore, take note that tags do not render their
     subcomponents automatically; it is necessary to call upon
     the TagComponent's renderComponents($vars) function.
