Custom Middleware
=================

Middleware is often important but lacking in most packages. In
fact, it is often the case that you need to customize your own
middleware for your projects.

Building and using a custom middleware is exceedingly simple:
the only requirement is that your middleware class must extend
from the AbstractMiddleware class. Of course, whether the
preprocesing and rendering functions are overridden is up to
you; without any overrides, a middleware class does absolutely
nothing.

As noted in the AbstractMiddleware class, there are only two
functions to consider: the "preprocess" and "render" functions.

The "preprocess()" function is run after all the
libraries files in "lib/" have been included, and before any
rendering is done. This is useful for pre-rendering checks, as
in the CSRF middleware.

The "render($text)" function is run after rendering the
template, with the rendered text in the variable $text. This is
essentially post-processing the output. The return value of
this function will ultimately be passed on to other middleware
before it is outputted to the client.

In order to use a middleware, add it to the list in
"settings.php", where the call is made to the __SITE class's
"addMiddleware" function. Remember that ordering is important.
