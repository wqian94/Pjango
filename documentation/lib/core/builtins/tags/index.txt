Tags
====

Tags comprise the programmatic sections of the template. Each
block is comprehended as a special set of commands to the PHP
scripting language, and it is used to emulate a scripting
environment within the context of the template.

Unlike filters, which accompany variables, and middleware,
which postprocess your output, tags can do a variety of things,
such as loops, conditionals, commenting, etc.

In order to give tags such versatility, tag usage is not very
strict. Like HTML, which has open and close tags, as well as
attributes, template tags can be block tags or self-closing,
and can have arguments passed into them.

A tag is denoted by curly braces and percent signs. For
example, this is the opening tag of an if-block;

{% if 1 != 42 %}

Note that we have passed in three arguments into the tag: 1,
!=, and 42. Arguments for tags are space-separated, but
strings that contain spaces will not be separated, e.g. "h i".

Since "if" is a block tag, it must be explicitly
closed with an ending tag. Ending tags are always of the form,
"end(tagname)". Thus, this tag closes the if-block:

{% endif %}

There are also tags that represent blocks, but are closed in
irregular fashions. The "else" tag is such a tag.
Since it is part of the if-block, it should be closed by an
endif.

Finally, there are also tags that are unclosed, such as the
extends tag. Since it has no functionality inside a
block, the extends tag remains unclosed, and does
not need a corresponding endextends tag.

Note that tags closed in irregular fashions are, in some sense,
a subcategory of unclosed tags, since they are not closed, with
respect to itself.

While the built-in library of tags is sufficient for most
purposes, it may be helpful to customize your own tags. This is
as simple as extending the AbstractTag class, implementing the
render function, and registering the tag with the
__SITE class.

Details about the AbstractTag class, custom tags and
built-in tags are available.
