Generating Documentation
========================

There are two ways to generate the documentation. The first is
run the make command from the command line, at the
documentation. The second is to run the documentationCompiler.php
script from the documentation root.

If you wish to remove all TXT and HTM files, you can call
make clean or run the documentationCleaner.php
script.
