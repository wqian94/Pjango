Core
====

This is the directory containing the bulk of the processing and
rendering components. Most notably, the __SITE, View, and
Token classes, and the AbstractComponent abstract and
subclasses (TagComponent, ValComponent, TxtComponent,
RootComponent) are declared in this sublibrary. The __SITE
class is contained in site.php, and the
remaining classes are in core.php.

Briefly, the system works as follows. During construction of
each page on the server, middleware, tags, and filters are
registered in the __SITE class, which is fully static. Then,
Upon requesting to render a template string, it is parsed into
tokens represented by the Token class, by the View class. Each
Token is then converted into an AbstractComponent subclass,
based solely on its content -- namely, the first two
characters. From here, the View class does a preliminary check
to make sure that tags are properly closed, and concurrently
generates a tree structure representing the relative depths of
the different components. Exceptions are made for special tags
that require attention at this step; most notably, verbatim,
which requires its closing tag to behave as a normal tag.
Finally, the root element -- the RootComponent the encompasses
all the internal components -- is given the call to render.

Upon receiving the call to render, the root element iterates
through each child component and recursively calls upon their
render() functions. Each component's rendering behavior
is different from the others, but their return values are all
the same -- the string that was generated to represent the
content within that component. The root element does simple
string concatenation of its children, and stores it in the
private instance variable rendered. Subsequent calls to
getRendered() from the root element will simple return
the previously rendered output.

More documentation on how each of the different components work
can be found in the core.php and site.php documentation files.
