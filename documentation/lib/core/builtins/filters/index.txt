Filters
=======

Filters are essentially in-template functions applied to
variables. For example, to apply the filter "add" to a variable
called "value", we would write

"{{ value|add:2 }}"

and the engine would replace that particular string with the
result of "value+2".

Pjango, like Django, provides for the ability to customize your
own filters, on top of the preexisting filters. This is done by
extending the AbstractFilter class and registering the filter
with the __SITE class.

Details about the AbstractFilter class, custom filters and
built-in filters are available.
