<<<CONTENT
Including library files in the <var>lib/</var> folder requires the use of
an <var>INCLUDE</var> file. The include file contains a directive on each
line, and each directive is a filename to include. Furthermore,
the special directive <var>*</var> will include all files and
subdirectories for that directory.
