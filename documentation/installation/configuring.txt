Variables Set-Up and Configuration
==================================

As with unpacking and installing, the easiest way to configure
your variables is to use the built-in index.php page.

However, if you wish to configure Pjango on your own, manualy,
navigate to the lib directory and open the settings.php file.
Here, you will find most of the configuration variables that
you will need to update. You will also need to update the
(WEBROOT) strings in .htaccess. Upon
updating, your configuration will be complete.
