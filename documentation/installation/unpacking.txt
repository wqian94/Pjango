Unpacking and Installing
========================

The easiest way to unpack, install, and configure your Pjango
project is to navigate to the root directory of your new Pjango
project in your web browser. The index.php will
guide you through the process.

If you wish to unpack and install manually, navigate to the
subdirectory named pjango-(version_number) and copy the
contents thereof into your projecct root directory. Note that
you will end up overwriting the prepackaged index.php file, and
will not be able to use it to complete installation or
configuration.
